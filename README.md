Welcome!

This is the working repo for GigMe, a WIP platform designed for local artists and musicians to simplify their event bookings and networking.

This app will be built in React with a future Native companion mobile app.

If you wish to, you may fork or clone this repository and run the app by running npm install, npm start from the main directory.

I will log my progress and some notes as I plug along.

There is a backend repository built with Node, Express, Knex, and Objection.

you can find it here: https://github.com/ToastMasterson/GigMeBackend

I welcome advice so long as it promotes a better platform in the end.

Thanks for checking it out!
